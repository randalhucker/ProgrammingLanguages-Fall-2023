1. I am extremely confused as to why we never flushed out the Transporter 'Ship' method!

2. I would like to see what would happen when we try to call getSerialNumber from inside the hospital. 
	Is there a way to check to see if the Shippable Object is also a Jarvik? If so, could we have done that instead of doing the Shippable interface?
		I am going to assume there is, but I was supposed to write these questions and not look up the answers.

3. Is it good practice to abstract all methods that are the same for concurrency? 

4. Could we have made the interface's getSchedule an abstract which would've made both the Medicine and Jarvik classes 
	need to make the overload, but could the necessity to make an overload for medicine class
	fall THROUGH the medicine class (ignore it) which would make the subclasses overload it and then we could've skipped defining that method in Medicine?
